# Gallagher-Humblet-Spira algorithm in DistAlgo
Implementation of the Gallagher-Humblet-Spira algorithm in DistAlgo (Python) for the INF571 Distributed Computing course.<br>
See *presentation.pdf* for more info.

### How to run it
Open a terminal in the root folder of the project and give the command
```
python -m da ghs.da
```
A random graph will be generated and shown; then, the algorith will run on it and, when it terminates, the spanning tree will be shown.
